The process of keeping virtual DOM in sync with the real DOM is called reconciliation.

Why virtual DOM is faster?
A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing's power to directly 
change what's on the screen. Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster,
because nothing gets drawn onscreen.
