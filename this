- An arrow function doesn't have its own this value. 
Instead, it uses the this value of the enclosing lexical scope. An arrow function also doesn't have the arguments object. Avoid using the arrow function for event handlers, object methods, 
prototype methods, and functions that use the arguments object.

function setTimer() {
    setTimeout(() => {
        // this here is lexically inherited from foo.
        console.log(this.a);
    }, 3000);
}

var obj3 = {a : 3};
setTimer.bind(obj3);
